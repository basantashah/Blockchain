## This repo is not intended to solve any issue or serve any purpose. I am developing this repo to test my `skill set` of using golang and blockchian

###### In this repo I will be developing a `CLI` based appplication to make my own wallet of Blockchain which can
```
1. Create new wallet
2. Transfer balance(Tokens)
3. Deploy my smart contract
4. Make transactions of tokens
```
## I will be updating this tree as I keep working on this directory.
